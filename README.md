# 3D Portfolio Website

This is my first project using **THREE.js**, where I built a simple 3D portfolio website. The goal of this project is to learnm more about 3D graphics and motion on web pages.

## Features

- Interactive 3D scene created with **THREE.js**
- Display of portfolio items in a 3D environment
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Basic camera controls (rotate)

## Technologies Used

- [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) â€“ A powerful 3D library for JavaScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- HTML5 / CSS3

## Setup and Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MatheusDSantossi/3D-website-portfolio.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd 3d-website-portfolio

Open the index.html file in your browser:

If you have a live server setup in your code editor (e.g., with VS Code), you can launch it by clicking Go Live.

Alternatively, just open the file directly in your browser.

Explore the interactive 3D portfolio!

Feel free to explore the code, and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions!
